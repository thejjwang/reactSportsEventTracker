# Sports Event Tracker

## Project Description

In this project, your task is to create a Sports Event Tracker web application using React. This project will not only showcase your ability to build user interfaces with React but also your skills in managing data using a JSON server (db.json) to persist and retrieve information.

## Project Requirements

### User Interface

Create a clean and intuitive user interface for the Sports Event Tracker. The interface should have the following components:

- Navigation Bar: Include navigation links for Home, Events, and About.
- Home Page: Display a welcome message and a brief description of the application.
- Events Page: Display a list of sports events with details such as event name, date, location, and a button to view event details.
- Event Details Page: Show detailed information about a selected event, including event name, date, location, teams/players involved, and any other relevant information.

### Data Management

- Use a JSON server (db.json) to persist data for sports events.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for sports events. Users should be able to add, view, edit, and delete events.

### Functionality

- Users should be able to navigate between different pages using the navigation bar.
- On the Events Page, users can view a list of sports events and click on an event to view its details on the Event Details Page.
- Users should have the ability to add new sports events.
- Users should be able to edit the details of an existing event.
- Users should be able to delete events they no longer want to track.

### Validation

- Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not empty when adding or editing events.

### Styling

- Apply CSS/Tailwind/Chakra/MaterialUI to style the page (You can choose any method or framework or even keep it vanilla CSS if you want).

### About Page

- Create an "About" page that provides information about the purpose of the Sports Event Tracker and credits for the developer (you!).

### Bonus Features (Optional)

- Implement user authentication to allow users to have personalized event lists.
- Add the ability to filter events by sport or date.
- Implement data sorting options (e.g., sort events by date).

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the project's GitHub repository link.
- Include clear README documentation that explains how to run the application locally.
- Provide screenshots of your application in the README to showcase its functionality.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- User Interface: Is the interface user-friendly and visually appealing?
- Functionality: Does the application perform all the required functions correctly?
- Data Management: Is data stored and retrieved accurately using the JSON server?
- Validation: Does the application validate user input effectively?
- Styling: Is the application well-styled and visually appealing?
- About Page: Does the "About" page provide useful information about the project?
- Bonus Features: Have any optional features been implemented effectively?
